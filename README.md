# Admin Scheduling Tool


## Project Overview
Cyber-Zamurai is a system designed to simplify academic scheduling by automating the allocation of teaching resources and centralizing course-related data. It enables administrators to manage a comprehensive database of faculty members and course offerings. The system streamlines the creation and modification of course sections, assigning qualified faculty based on their availability and expertise.
